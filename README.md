# Introduction
This repository has been created with the aim of storing all the material produced for the '*Advanced Algorithms and Programming Methods*' course, for both the ***theoretical*** (*cliffsnotes*) and ***practical*** (*tasks/assignments*) parts.

All the material was developed for the '*Advanced Algorithms and Programming Methods*' [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it) master's degree course in '*Software Dependability and Cyber Security*' (2019/2020).

# Cliffsnotes

# Assignments
The main goal of these assignments were to implement from scratch a ***tensor library*** in *C++*. 

In the following list you will find all the resources related for each task (*assignment, solution and documentation*) by just clicking on the name of the assignment. Keep in mind that each task takes as a starting point the previous one.

1. [**Task 1**](https://github.com/FabioDainese/Advanced_Algorithms/tree/master/Assignments/1/): Implement a templated ***library handling tensors*** with various data-access functions;
2. [**Task 2**](https://github.com/FabioDainese/Advanced_Algorithms/tree/master/Assignments/2/): Augment the tensor library with the ability to perform tensor operations using the ***Einstein's notation***;
3. [**Task 3**](https://github.com/FabioDainese/Advanced_Algorithms/tree/master/Assignments/3/): Augment the tensor library with the ability to ***parallelize*** the operations on tensors;
